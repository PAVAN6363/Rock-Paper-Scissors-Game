# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
This classic hand game allows a user to play against the computer. The player selects either rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly picks one as well. The game then determines the winner according to the traditional rules:

The score is tracked live, and the game provides immediate feedback on who won, lost, or if it‚Äôs a draw.
